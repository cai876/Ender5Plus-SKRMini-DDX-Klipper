# Ender5Plus-SKRMini-DDX-Klipper

This repository contains my Klipper configuration files for the Ender 5 Plus with an SKR Mini E3 V3.0 silent board, Bondtech DDX extruder, Mosquito Magnum hotend, and a 0.6mm CHT nozzle. These files include basic tuning like PID calibration but are not fully fine-tuned yet
